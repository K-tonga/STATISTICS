  3.Households randomly selected from a list prepared by agricultural authorities.
Two key questions that can be studied are:

  2. 
The statistical analysis method I would use is . The hypothesis would be:
  Null - 
  Alternate -
Tests to be used:
  1. 
  2.
Determerning the significance:
  1. 
  2.
